# uxplay_gui
a gui for uxplay, to make it look a little nicer

This is built for ubuntu/linux computers running on a 1080p display

built with PySimpleGui(for the gui) and pexpect(terminal stuff with uxplay)

the image and font are property of other people, i didnt make them nor do i own them

credits to the people who made uxplay(https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay), they did pretty much all the hard work here
